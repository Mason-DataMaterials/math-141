- `mutate()`
- `summarize()`
- `group_by()`

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(pnwflights14)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
data(flights)

head(flights)
str(flights)

# what proportion of flights were out of PDX?

# which airport has lower departure delays?

# which airline has the least departure delays out of PDX?

# what is the tail number of the plane with the fastest avg_speed?

```
